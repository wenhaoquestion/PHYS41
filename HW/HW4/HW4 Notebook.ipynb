    "\n",
    "**Objective:**\n",
    "In this assignment, you will build a complete Self-Attention block for a single sentence from scratch. Here you will start with the **raw input vectors** and generate the Queries, Keys, and Values yourself using **Matrix Multiplication**. This mimics the actual architecture of a Transformer layer (like in GPT or BERT).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Context: What is \"Word Embedding\"?**\n",
    "Before we do math, let's talk about data. Computers cannot understand strings like \"Apple\". To process language, we convert every word into a list of numbers called a **Vector**.\n",
    "* This conversion is called **Word Embedding**.\n",
    "* The key idea is that words with similar meanings (like \"King\" and \"Queen\") will have vectors that are numerically close to each other.\n",
    "* For this homework, we assume our sentence has **128 words**, and each word is represented by a vector of **size 16**."

    "In a real Transformer, we don't just use the input vectors directly. We \"project\" them into three different spaces: Query, Key, and Value. We do this by multiplying the input by three learnable weight matrices: $W_Q, W_K, W_V$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:**\n",
    "1.  Set the random seed to `42`.\n",
    "2.  Generate a \"Input Sentence\" matrix $X$ of shape `(128, 16)` using standard random normal matrix (`rand`).\n",
    "    * 128 = Sequence Length (Words)\n",

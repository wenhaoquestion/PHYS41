    "**(a)** Write a function that can take both numbers and numpy arrays as input, let's call it $X$. If $X$ is just a number, return $X^2$. If it is an array, use a for loop to find the largest element of the array, $y$, and have it return $y^2$. The function numpy.iterable useful. Look up the documentation on this function and show how it works and then use it in your solution.\n",

You want to return an array of the same shape and takes the value of $A+B$ when $A+B > C$ AND $A+B < 2 C^2$ and return $-C$ otherwise. Use functions like np.where and np.logical_and rather than for loops. Show that your function works as desired on several examples."
